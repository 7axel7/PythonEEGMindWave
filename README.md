PythonEEGMindWave
=================

Python code for getting real time data out of a mindwave.

This code was written for a science fair project. It gets the Mindwave(TM) hooked up via python and
plots the data in real time, and lets you perform some experiments.  It has a simple blink
detection algorithm included.  It assumes you have scipy/numpy and matplotlib installed.  No
warranties of any kind, feel free to modify and distribute.  I had a hard time finding something
like this, so thought I'd post it.

To use this, first connect the mindwave and make sure you have a good signal (e.g. using BlinkZone). 
Then close blinkzone and run this in a console, and choose an experiment to run. Enjoy.
